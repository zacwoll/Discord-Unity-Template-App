# Discord-Unity-Template-App

This project is a template unity game hosted inside of a Discord Activity. The discord embedded-app sdk is utilized by the Dissonity package, and Dissonity does most of the heavy lifting between Discord and Unity. The project exists as a example project combining these tools and streamlining the process such that a Unity Developer can quickly make a Unity game for Discord.
